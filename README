vim settings for tinyHippos.

These are just a starting point, feel free to edit them as you wish.

Just copy to your home dir and enjoy.

Requirements:

Ack plugin:

NOTE: You must, of course, install the ack script
in your path.
On Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install ack-grep
ln -s /usr/bin/ack-grep /usr/bin/ack
With MacPorts:
sudo port install p5-app-ack

jsLint plugin:

This is currently a hack of a plugin that we have been working on (combining a couple other plugins out there)
there is a hardcoded path to the .jslintrc at the bottom of the plugin script you will need to edit to
have this work for you.

ConqueTerm:

This plugin requires vim to be build with python.
